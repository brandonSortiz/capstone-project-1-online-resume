  <h1>Brandon's Hobbies</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Here is a small list of my favorite hobbies to do on my free time!</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Kendama</strong> - This is a japanese skill toy that not only is a fun way
      to pass the time but build your hand eye coordination! There are an infinite amount of tricks that you can learn 
      and attempt to create a line which consists of back to back tricks!
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Spikeball</strong> - This is a new sport that utilizes a small circular net/trampoline placed on the floor, played with teams of 2.
    A player starts a point by serving the small bouncy ball onto the Spikeball net so it ricochets up towards his opponent. </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Videogames</strong> - I have been playing videos games ever since I was about 10 years old when my father got me a 
    gameboy advanced with the game pokemon fire red! As of recent I have been playing the soul games created by <em>FromSoftware, Inc.</em></li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Getting Jacked</strong> - The summer of 2022 I decided I wanted to make a change and build myself a bigger frame. 
    I started going to the gym 5-7 days a week consistently and increasing my protein and calorie intake. I went from 
    weighing 135 pounds to a killer 190 pounds in a matter of a year and a half!</li>
